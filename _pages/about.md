<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Lili Miao, a computational social science researcher who specializes in studying science policy and the science of science to understand national scientific competitiveness. I am currently completing my Ph.D. at Indiana University Bloomington under the guidance of Professor [Yong-Yeol Ahn](http://yongyeol.com/) and [Cassidy Sugimoto](https://spp.gatech.edu/people/person/sugimoto-cassidy).
 

My research interests lie at the intersection of computational social science and the science of science. Specifically, I develop and utilize computational approaches to investigate the underlying universal patterns of scientific enterprise and the intricate interactions between science and society.


My CV is available for [download here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qmzhangGit/qmzhangGit.github.io/main/_pages/CV_Zhang.pdf).
